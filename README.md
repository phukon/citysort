A live index of the best cities to live and work in India, based on crowdsourced data. Inspired by a viral tweet that initiated discussions about city ratings, this platform aims to collect and present insights from the community, enabling individuals to share their perspectives and experiences about different cities in India.

## Background

The inception of CitySort stemmed from a viral tweet that prompted followers to rate their cities based on various parameters. Witnessing the engaging conversations in the comment section, the idea emerged to create a platform dedicated to collecting and aggregating data about Indian cities. Recognizing the power of collective knowledge, this project thrives on community contributions, valuing the diverse opinions and experiences of individuals across the country.

## Objective

The primary goal of CitySort is to create a comprehensive and informative resource that offers valuable insights into different cities in India. By harnessing the collective knowledge of residents, workers, and visitors, the platform aims to assist individuals in making informed decisions about where to live, work, or visit within India.

## How It Works

CitySort operates as a crowdsourced platform where users can contribute their ratings, reviews, and opinions about various cities in India. The platform is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing visitors to explore different cities, view aggregated ratings, and read detailed reviews to gain a comprehensive understanding of each location. The data may initially be limited, but it's the collective input from the community that will enhance and enrich the platform.

## Contribution Guidelines

CitySort follows the Conventional Commits specification and Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for version control and commits. To ensure a consistent and structured approach to contributions, we encourage all contributors to adhere to these guidelines when submitting changes.

## Conventional Commits

Conventional Commits provide a standardized format for commit messages, making it easier to understand the nature of changes made to the project. When making commits, please use the conventional commit format, which typically follows the pattern of `<type>: <description>`. For example:
- `feat: Add new rating component`
- `fix: Resolve issue with city search feature`
- `docs: Update README with new contribution guidelines`

**Summary**: The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention for structuring commit messages. It provides clear rules for creating a descriptive commit history and aligns with Semantic Versioning (SemVer) by categorizing changes into features, fixes, and breaking changes.

## Types of Commits

In addition to `fix` and `feat`, other types are allowed to categorize commits. For instance, the @commitlint/config-conventional, based on the Angular convention, recommends using:

- `build`: Changes related to build processes or tools.
- `chore`: Regular maintenance or administrative tasks.
- `ci`: Updates to the continuous integration setup.
- `docs`: Documentation-related changes.
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the code's functionality (e.g., formatting).
- `refactor`: Code modifications without changing its behavior.
- `perf`: Performance improvements.
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests.

You can use these types to categorize your commits according to their nature. This helps maintain consistency in commit messages and aids in better organization of changes in the project history.

### Commit Message Structure

A commit message should follow this structure:

```markdown
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

CitySort adheres to Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for versioning releases. The versioning system consists of three numbers: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, where:
- `MAJOR` version increments for incompatible API changes,
- `MINOR` version for backward-compatible functionality additions, and
- `PATCH` version for backward-compatible bug fixes.

Please consider the impact of your changes when determining version updates.

For more information on Semantic Versioning, visit [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).
